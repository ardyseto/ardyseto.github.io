I am a lecturer in the Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department at the Vocational Faculty, Universitas Negeri Yogyakarta. With a passion for teaching and learning, I specialize in areas such as programming, arduino and related technologies, control systems, robotics, and artificial intelligence. I find great joy in exploring new concepts and sharing knowledge with others, always striving to inspire students and colleagues alike.

Outside of work, I am deeply enthusiastic about tinkering with electronics and diving into the latest advancements in technology. I enjoy meeting new people and engaging in meaningful conversations, though I also value moments of quiet reflection to recharge and focus.

Whether it’s in the classroom, the lab, or through collaborative projects, I am committed to fostering innovation and lifelong learning. Let’s connect and explore the exciting world of technology together!
